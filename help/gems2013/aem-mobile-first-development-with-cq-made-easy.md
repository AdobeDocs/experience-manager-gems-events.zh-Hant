title: Mobile-first development with CQ made easy
description: Learn the patterns for responsive design in CQ and how to provide a media-rich HTML5 mobile experience that performs on low-bandwidth connections. To demonstrate these patterns, we work through the transformation of a CQ site from desktop only to mobile-first. We dive into how mobile-first design principles were used, adaptive images and progressive enhancement to create it, and we discuss the pitfalls encountered along the way. The session is based on Bruce's talk during the CQ Conference in Basel, Switzerland (CQCON, 2013).
