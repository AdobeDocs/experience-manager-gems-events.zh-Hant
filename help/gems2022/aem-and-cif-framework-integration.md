# Integrate AEM & CIF framework to build a rich and immersive e-commerce experience

This AEM GEMs webinar includes a presentation and demo to help you understand how Adobe’s CIF framework can be used to build a consistent and content-rich and immersive commerce experience. The Experience Manager and Adobe Commerce are seamlessly integrated using the Commerce Integration Framework (CIF). CIF enables AEM to directly access and communicate with the commerce instance using Adobe Commerce’s GraphQL APIs (View the high level agenda below).
