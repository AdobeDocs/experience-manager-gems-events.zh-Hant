# Build websites faster with AEM Headless and App Builder

This AEM GEMs webinar recording includes a presentation and demo on the following:

Quickly bootstrap and deploy single-page apps (SPA) using Adobe App Builder workflows and tools, without traditional Experience Manager skills, like Java and Sling, being required. With Experience Manager Headless, marketers and developers can have expertise in their own domain. Developers control the overall application framework while marketers determine the content and how itâ€™s displayed.
