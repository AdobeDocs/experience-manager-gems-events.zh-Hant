# The Digital Asset Explosion & [!DNL AEM Assets]{#the-digital-asset-explosion-aem-assets}

At Adobe, we have been observing an explosion in digital assets in 4 key areas:

* The file size of digital assets being produced
* The number of digital assets being produced
* The expectations of our users and customers for digital assets
* The requests for larger and larger [!DNL AEM Assets] deployments

In this session, we will learn about the Digital Asset Explosion, understanding the scale of AEM as assets explode, and follow a customer example through the lifecycle of their [!DNL AEM Assets] project.
