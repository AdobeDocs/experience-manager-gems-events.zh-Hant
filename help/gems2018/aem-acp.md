# Adobe Experience Platform - The Heart of Experience Cloud{#adobe-experience-platform-the-heart-of-experience-cloud}

Everything starts with the Adobe Experience Platform. Discover how the platform plays a role in the experience business, helping you identify, understand, and engage customers and deliver consistent, continuous, and compelling experiences that delight them at every turn. In itself the platform is a System of Record for the Experience Business.  Find out exactly what we mean by platform, including what it is, where it’s heading, how you can get value now and in the future, and even how Adobe partners can get involved. Of course, we won’t just talk about it, you’ll see it in action, too.

* The components that make up Adobe Experience Platform – Data Services
