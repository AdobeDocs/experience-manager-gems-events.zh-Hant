Goran Brodnik:Welcome to Granite Gems!
 
 
  
Kaushal Mall:all the slides said 6.5 .. Is that the targeted version?
 
 
  
Vlad Petcu:6.5 was the example for 1 click upgrade that JM envisioned
 
 
  
Vlad Petcu:BC is starting with 6.4
 
 
  
Oscar Bolaños:It should start with 6.4
 
 
  
Toto Tuo:Is AEM upgrade process going to get easier, right now it is
very manual, long and complicated process
 
 
  
Kaushal Mall:Thanks Vlad & Oscar
 
 
  
Goran Brodnik:MS Reimagined 6.4 link: https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwiki.corp.adobe.com%2Fdisplay%2FWEM%2FPPC%2B-%2BMS%2BReimagined%2B6.4&data=02%7C01%7C%7C9d7532666b894b15d4f608d4e9770960%7Cfa7b1b5a7b34438794aed2c178decee1%7C0%7C0%7C636390144844402697&sdata=gwBo0cpxz9eAGSsOrIo6Zt8H8B1tEzD3Ka5NK%2FFlU3M%3D&reserved=0
 
 
  
Rishabh Sharma:if not 1 click upgrade, may be a near automated
assessment of the source system, and generation of scripts that could take care
of "some part" of the manual activities
 
 
  
Vlad Petcu:Toto that's the plan, we need to improve a lot into making
upgrade easier for everyone
 
 
  
Andrei Dulvac:If we have one big BC switch on, what's the difference
between 6.4+compat-pack and a 6.3 updated instance?
 
 
  
Bertrand Delacretaz:I was going to ask exactly that
 
 
  
Bertrand Delacretaz:as a customer, why do I want to pay for a 6.4
upgrade if I end up running 6.3 due to this compat package?
 
 
  
chris-k:because you save penality from ms
 
 
  
Arek Kita:One of the improvements for 6.4 with compat mode on will be
newer Oak, Sling and in general platform versions.
 
 
  
Oscar Bolaños:Are we moving ClassicUI, Coral2 to the compat package?
 
 
  
J. Casalino:Does the compatibility pack add duplicate bundles with older
versions?
 
 
  
Alexander Klimetschek:you get all the features and updates that are not
affected by backwards compatiblity special handling
 
 
  
chris-k:@casalino this is not possible
 
 
  
Alexander Klimetschek:as jmp said, there are hopefully more than zero :)
 
 
  
Bertrand Delacretaz:yeah I guess how many new features still work with
the compat mode on is the big question
 
 
  
Mitch Nelson:Lets please remember that the reason AMS has an upgrade
requirement is to make sure the customer is using the new features..
 
 
  
chris-k:@mitch
 
 
  
Mitch Nelson:So we need to be careful around sabotaging that intent
 
 
  
chris-k:@mitch they can't as they need integrators to use the new
feature
 
 
  
Bertrand Delacretaz:Agreed Mitch, that sabotaging is what I'm afraid
might happen depending on how many things the compat mode hides.
 
 
  
Andrei Dulvac:In a larger context, if featurepacks are faded out in
favor of a more unified package, it's expected that some features that used to
be FPs will go into something like the servicepack, keeping fixes for
cumulativefixpack. Was that taken into consideration when comparing 6.3 with
all updates and 6.4 with the compat mode on ?
 
 
  
Mitch Nelson:@chris-k, do not understand your comment.
 
 
  
chris-k:if we have a new service you need new component to use it
 
 
  
Alexander Klimetschek:AFAIK the vision is FIRST to make stuff backwards
compatible, and only if that is really not possible SECOND put it in the BC
package as last resort (Dominik's yellow warning box on his slide)
 
 
  
Costin Genescu:yes.
 
 
  
chris-k:@alex as any resource is API you cant do much comptiable
 
 
  
Alexander Klimetschek:seems like people get the impression the BC
package is all we do for the upgrade goal, I think that is highly misleading
right now
 
 
  
Costin Genescu:also. based on business considerations we could decide to
provide additional granularity than on/off switch
 
 
  
chris-k:what eles is there
 
 
  
Goran Brodnik:PLEASE MUTE YOUR MICROPHONES IF YOU'RE NOT PRESENTING!
THANKS
 
 
  
Mitch Nelson:@chirs-k, that seems to be a given.  We have no problems with adding new stuff.
 
 
  
Mitch Nelson:We need to look at how we break the old stuff.
 
 
  
chris-k:so what is the way they make them use new features
 
 
  
chris-k:that doesn't happen automatically
 
 
  
Mitch Nelson:@chris, customers are adding code often on a weekly basis.
 
 
  
Oscar Bolaños:How will the customer determine the there is a newer
version?
 
 
  
Daniel Gordon:is it all or nothing for compat? Can you use some old
features and some new?
 
 
  
Mitch Nelson:They can start integrating new features as a part of the
thread.
 
 
  
J. Casalino:How would a customer with no customizer know/be able to flip
this compatibility switch?
 
 
  
J. Casalino:How will compatibility and 6.4 upgrade affect workflow
models?
 
 
  
Alexander Klimetschek:@chis-k my understanding is that once upgrade is
simple and automatic, it's no longer a roadblock to the discussion; once the
customer has upgraded and sees the new features that need a system integrator
to be leveraged, then they see the value and would pay for it; but today they
have the impressoin they pay for just keeping what they have
 
 
  
Bertrand Delacretaz:Alex K agreed compat mode is only one element. IMO
the only way to make things easier in the future is also to enforce a much more
restricted extension model.
 
 
  
chris-k:@bertrabd tgat us removing api and thus incompaible
 
 
  
Bertrand Delacretaz:chris-k you need to draw a line at some point, or
stay stuck in the past.
 
 
  
Alexander Klimetschek:@bertrand: fully agree. I have the feeling that
starting the BC gem sessions here with the BC package is sending a slightly
confusing message, I would start with how we can keep things backwards
compatible, how we design proper extension points, what stuff like overlays is
causing the biggest problems and how to address them etc
 
 
  
chris-k:@ I agree but you cant have both
 
 
  
chris-k:thats the problem
 
 
  
Costin Genescu:@alex, @bertrand that's the next part of the presentation
 
 
  
Alexander Klimetschek:ok
 
 
  
Bertrand Delacretaz:A past where customers bought CQ as an applications
platform, and didn't mind recompiling and making slight adjustements to their
code, as they had strong automated tests to validate it. If now and in the
future people buy AEM as a solution with some customizability, that
customizability can only happen with a much more restricted model, in order to
support their different view of what upgrading means.
 
 
  
chris-k:@but bertrand that is not supported with the given road-map
 
 
  
Oscar Bolaños:@chris-k: it does make sense
 
 
  
Oscar Bolaños:it could be the time to disable overlays, and some
extension points that we know that do not scale
 
 
  
Gilles Metz:will the new extension model/surface API guarantee 100%
future backw. comp to customers who use it starting from 6.4 ?
 
 
  
chris-k:@oscar it makes sense and is high time. But this makes
everything incomptaible in 6.4
 
 
  
Oscar Bolaños:it could be "disabled" as part of the compat
mode
 
 
  
Oscar Bolaños:but if you are a customer that has never never 6.3
 
 
  
Oscar Bolaños:then it makes sense that 6.4 does not allow such practices
 
 
  
Toto Tuo:When 6.3 first came out, it did not support/work well with s3
as data store for upgrade, considering we have quite a lot customers on s3, are
we going to see similar issue with aem 6.4?
 
 
  
Bertrand Delacretaz:right @chris-k, so I'm pessimistic about that
roadmap...
 
 
  
Mitch Nelson:@Toto, we are working to change the testing model,
increasing the base of Azure/AWS testing, so that some of those issues get
caught earlier.
 
 
  
Toto Tuo:Thanks Mitch!
 
 
  
Kaushal Mall:so, we won't be able to say "you can customize pretty
much everything in AEM" anymore.
 
 
  
chris-k:that was wrong anyway
 
 
  
Costin Genescu:the customer can chose to customise anything. but the
price they will pay is complex upgrade.
 
 
  
chris-k:that was in place since ever
 
 
  
Alexander Klimetschek:@kaushall kind of, but today we have many ways how
you could change things, and that also makes it hard to keep backwards
compatibility for all those ways
 
 
  
Kaushal Mall:agreed, but, in the field that phrase gets thrown around a
lot.
 
 
  
Alexander Klimetschek:I guess we wouldn't change that you have an osgi
runtime that can execute your custom stuff, giving a lot of freedom; the
problem is in changes/interaction touching on product features
 
 
  
Alexander Klimetschek:(for 6.4 et al)
 
 
  
Kaushal Mall:so, the content nodes marked as "internal" can
still be overlayed and customized, just like today,  right?
 
 
  
Oscar Bolaños:no
 
 
  
Kaushal Mall:or "private"
 
 
  
Oscar Bolaños:AEM won't have a runtime check, but it would appear in the
health dashboard as a problem
 
 
  
Oscar Bolaños:so customers would know that the partner code violates the
best practices
 
 
  
Bertrand Delacretaz:To me ideally there should be two modes: 1)
customize anything you want, at a price and 2) flip a "restrictions"
switch which blocks any extensions for which we cannot guarantee zero cost
upgrade
 
 
  
Kaushal Mall:@Oscar, thanks. thats actually a good thing because we've
had to create reports for clients in the past for customizations that have been
done. So, a dashboard is a good thing
 
 
  
Bertrand Delacretaz:Oscar yes, if a HC that acts as my
"restrictions" switch can be implemented that would be fantastic
 
 
  
Costin Genescu:@bertrand: yes
 
 
  
Bertrand Delacretaz:but that would only work with a whitelist IMO, and
anything outside of it is flagged
 
 
  
Oscar Bolaños:in reality we could lift restrictions when compat mode is
on
 
 
  
Alexander Klimetschek:btw, we need better long running HC support, with
progress bar support
 
 
  
Oscar Bolaños:this way if a customer has only seen 6.4 the it would
won't be able to do it
 
 
  
Bertrand Delacretaz:Oscar, compat mode gives you a crippled system, as a
customer I would consider it a band-aid
 
 
  
Bertrand Delacretaz:but a HC that tells me if my extensions are within
bounds for painless upgrade - YES
 
 
  
Alexander Klimetschek:do we have a plan for a pre upgrade check tool
that tells you whether you need the compat mode or not?
 
 
  
Bertrand Delacretaz:If I was whoever-allocates-money-to-things I would
put a lot of $ on making that HC happen.
 
 
  
Justin Edelson:because we don't have UI extension points
 
 
  
Justin Edelson:we just have the overlay model today
 
 
  
Arek Kita:@alex: Yes - that's a goal of Pattern Detector - it will be
acting as HC as well.
 
 
  
Oscar Bolaños:that's the "extension" point :)
 
 
  
Bertrand Delacretaz:Arek where's that Pattern Detector?
 
 
  
Oscar Bolaños:but it is basically killing us
 
 
  
Justin Edelson:fair enough @Oscar
 
 
  
Costin Genescu:@bertrand: next week we'll have a session for the pattern
detector
 
 
  
Justin Edelson:we can play the definition game all day
 
 
  
Bertrand Delacretaz:Can I have a URL, not a session? I'll be off sailing
next week ;-)
 
 
  
Arek Kita:@bertrand: I've sent an email to DL-dev with POC ca 2 weeks
ago (pattern detector in subject line)
 
 
  
Bertrand
Delacretaz:https://wiki.corp.adobe.com/display/WEM/CQ-85533+-+Pattern+detector+for+potentially+breaking+customizations
?
 
 
  
Arek Kita:yes
 
 
  
Bertrand Delacretaz:thanks

Alexander Klimetschek:Question: please repeat the BC package/compat mode
is a last resort
 
 
  
chris-k:@alex sites needs it for all changes made for 0dt
 
 
  
Alexander Klimetschek:I had the feeling folks got the wrong impression
because the session started with it, like everything goes in there and then we
are done
 
 
  
chris-k:what else to you have to offer
 
 
  
Alexander Klimetschek:a decision flow chart would help
 
 
  
Alexander Klimetschek:that's not true, 6.3 had a breaking change that
was done after repeated complains
 
 
  
Costin Genescu:please check this epic: https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fjira.corp.adobe.com%2Fbrowse%2FCQ-4194070&data=02%7C01%7C%7C9d7532666b894b15d4f608d4e9770960%7Cfa7b1b5a7b34438794aed2c178decee1%7C0%7C0%7C636390144844402697&sdata=CRX2Bycx3zeyC%2FK1wlQ1cD%2BzE87FFmSSK3vrJ1SGvZc%3D&reserved=0
 
 
  
Bertrand Delacretaz:Thanks everybody for a lively meeting, that's unusual.
It shows how much people care about this.
 
 
  
Arek Kita:yeah BC is definitely hot topic  :) see you next week
 
 
  
Costin Genescu:thanks guys. p
 
 
  
Goran Brodnik:Thanks!
 
 
  
Kaushal Mall:thanks guys
