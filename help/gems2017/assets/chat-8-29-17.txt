Krystian Nowak:I can hear you well
 
 
  
Andrei Dulvac:yup, sounds good from bebbi
 
 
  
Andrei Dulvac:there's someone talking now, muffled
 
 
  
Andrei Dulvac:can you mute your mics, please?
 
 
  
Andrei Dulvac:------ MUTE YOUR MICS, PLEASE --------
 
 
  
Andrei Dulvac:Please mute your mics!
 
 
  
Justin Edelson:what is an "incorrect overlay"?
 
 
  
Dominik Suess:phrasing is probably to be fixed ;) - it is a potentially
breaking overlay.. the patterns right now are not finetuned so there are false
positives
 
 
  
Brendan Robert:We could benefit from this pattern detector for other
uses than upgrades.  We also need to
audit partner engagements for customers from time to time, also if we are
assisting with security audits it helps to produce a list of customizations installed.
 
 
  
Dominik Suess:@brendan - good point - I guess we should add some kind of
classification similar as we have for healthchecks
 
 
  pflory@adobe.com:Would be useful even
as a real-time *pre commit* source code check, for customer's / developer's
ongoing AEM customizations -- make sure they aren't introducing potential
issues.
 
 
  
Dominik Suess:we start with this limited scope but it certainly can be
extended beyond this use - we'll anyhow have to talk with helpx team about
making sure that we can have a corresponding "resolution" DB
 
 
  
Andrei Dulvac:bless you!
 
 
  
Dominik Suess:@paul - that likely would wire this too deep into the
deployment mechanisms etc. We anyhow expect customers to deploy to stage first
and such a check would be an easy and automation friendly smoke test (as any
HC)
 
 
  
Justin Edelson:this should definitely be integrated into the AMS SSF
pipeline
 
 
  pflory@adobe.com:Ok, so not along the
lines of SonarQube rules... In any case, anything to help during the dev cycle
is welcomed!
 
 
  
Justin Edelson:that's a good point Paul... I'm not sure if Sonar can do
all of this
 
 
  
Justin Edelson:but either way, the implementation isn't as important as
the end goal
 
 
  
Justin Edelson:(by implementation, I mean the specific tool used to
implement the checks)
 
 
  
Brendan Robert:Well having an external tool that can audit from above
would be helpful.  The same checks could
be rolled into a maven task as part of packaging since anaylzing a package
would work the same in both cases.
 
 
  
Dominik Suess:note that the pattern and the resolution db will be not
hardwired - so the PD only reports a rough indicator and a key that allows
lookup in helpx for corresponding guidance - that allows us to adjust our
recommendations as we learn where generic recommendations might not match
 
 
  
Brendan Robert:Here's a novel starting point for an external scan tool: https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FAdobe-Consulting-Services%2Faem-epic-tool&data=02%7C01%7C%7Cb64b16fb46b24312e05c08d4f03e9bc2%7Cfa7b1b5a7b34438794aed2c178decee1%7C0%7C0%7C636397599074108967&sdata=UFBayFx1qsqju0fqa5YMa%2FlzjM8qohOuXPhww7GP29c%3D&reserved=0
 
 
  
Justin Edelson:you don't really need a separate tool. just a server side
test which runs the HC
 
 
  
Dominik Suess:@Brendan the MAEM agent basically is about making the data
extractable for external consumption, where PD adds a thin layer about cheap
checks on top of this to provide info within the instance
 
 
  
Justin Edelson:such a test could run as part of the SSF
 
 
  
Brendan Robert:Depends on if it is a project you have control over,
Justin.  Watch-dogging partners or
on-prem customers might only afford you access to /crx/packmgr
 
 
  pflory@adobe.com:Rename
"anti-patterns" to "smells"?  Makes it more fun :-)
 
 
  
Justin Edelson:access to HC output shouldn't be controversial
 
 
  
Brendan Robert:Oh for sure.
 
 
  
Justin Edelson:I'm talking about from a CI perspective in the SSF
pipeline
 
 
  
Brendan Robert:Is this HC going to be back-ported to 6.1/6.2?
 
 
  
Justin Edelson:manual review is a different story
 
 
  
Brendan Robert:It also becomes a good estimation framework.  If you know number and complexity of
extensions it better helps you understand effort required for upgrades or
audits alike.
 
 
  
chris-k:for content / libs stuff it may be much more effective than
thinking of patterns
 
 
  
Dominik Suess:@brendan - yes the check will be available for 6.1 upwards
at least.. 6.0 currently poses a little challenge for the MAEM agent but
despite of that we need 6.1 and 6.2 to make use for upgrades "TO" 6.4
;)
 
 
  
Brendan Robert:That is encouraging.
Thanks Dominik!
 
 
  
Arek Kita:>>> Justin Edelson: this should definitely be
integrated into the AMS SSF pipeline
 
 
  
Arek Kita:yes I already had a chat with AMS SSF team about that and we
are planning to integrate it.
 
 
  
Arek Kita:>>> Justin Edelson: that's a good point Paul... I'm
not sure if Sonar can do all of this
 
 
  
Alexander Klimetschek:are we actually expecting most customers that
upgrade to 6.4 will come from 6.3?
 
 
  
Dominik Suess:@Brendan  - I would
suggest to play around with PD as soon as possible (esp when you have clones of
customer instances) so we get better wrt false positives and negatives and get
an idea on what kind of guidance would be reuqired
 
 
  
Arek Kita:It seems some check are not possible (according to the team
working on AMS SSF)
 
 
  
Arek Kita:They operate on source code. PD operates in runtime on byte
code (different area)
 
 
  
Dominik Suess:@Alex - no but it's the only upgrade path where we can
currently provide a no-touch ugprade as 6.2 -> 6.3 already introduce
breaking changes
 
 
  
Justin Edelson:@Arek - that sounds wrong. let's talk offline. SSF will
run tests on a live AEM instance
 
 
  
Alexander Klimetschek:@Dominik - yeah, but we might want to fix that :)
 
 
  
Justin Edelson:in addition to doing static analysis
 
 
  
Justin Edelson:it's just a different stage in the pipeline
 
 
  
Alexander Klimetschek:otherwise if we have no customers upgrading to 6.3
because of the cost, then it doesn't help if we make 6.3 to 6.4 easier
 
 
  
Dominik Suess:Alex.. a) AMS is expeciting more customers to do N+1 when
they don't have the upgrade costs invoked b) we will at latest have the payoff
in 6.3 -> 6.5 upgrades (even if majority stays with N+2 upgrades)
 
 
  
Arek Kita:@Justin you're right. SSF fires AEM for IT tests but I meant
here static analysis and I meant that summary: https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwiki.corp.adobe.com%2Fdisplay%2FWEM%2FRules%2Bnot%2Bcovered%2Bby%2BSonarQube&data=02%7C01%7C%7Cb64b16fb46b24312e05c08d4f03e9bc2%7Cfa7b1b5a7b34438794aed2c178decee1%7C0%7C0%7C636397599074265223&sdata=f7O%2BOmZ8OuiXPvIg4LihBCDG9Yno2vvXYYGqwICQxUk%3D&reserved=0
 
 
  
Arek Kita:It seems that the focus currently for SSF is on static
analysis IIRC
 
 
  
Justin Edelson:@Arek - whether or not the "current" focus is
correct is a separate issue :) SSF needs to accomodate whatever test scenarios
are deemed to be critical to  customer
susccss
 
 
  
Justin Edelson:what phase of the pipeline they are accomodated is an
implementation detail
 
 
  
Elham Chandler:So the improvements won't be helpful for 6.2->6.4....
 
 
  
Elham Chandler:that's too bad
 
 
  
Justin Edelson:@Elham - IMO that is a misreading
 
 
  
Justin Edelson:PD has benefits for any customer on 6.1 or higher
 
 
  
Elham Chandler:thanks for the clarification
 
 
  
Justin Edelson:BC has benefit for the same in that it limits the change
surface for any upgrade
 
 
  
Justin Edelson:but it doesn't remove the change surface for 6.1 or 6.2
customers
 
 
  
Justin Edelson:it just locks in the scope
 
 
  
Justin Edelson:to what is already there in 6.3
 
 
  
Justin Edelson:i.e. a 6.1 to 6.4 upgrade is the same LOE as a 6.1 to 6.3
upgrade
 
 
  
Justin Edelson:if we assume that the LOE is dependent upon the # of
skipped versions, that is a significant difference
 
 
  
Justin Edelson:question - in the program meeting today, Pierre mentioned
that compat packages shouldn't violate 0DT constraints. is that covered by the
current tests?
 
 
  
chris-k:@justin its a nice wish
 
 
  
chris-k:but the 0dt was about mistakes in content-model
 
 
  
Justin Edelson:@chris I hadn't heard that as a constraint before
 
 
  
Justin Edelson:(on the compat packages0
 
 
  
Andrei Dulvac:that would have to be covered by the 0DT deployment tests
 
 
  
chris-k:especially this changs are breaking compatibility
 
 
  
chris-k:odt problems have been of a lack in separation of content
according their concerns
 
 
  
chris-k:aka they mixed system content (private) with customer content
 
 
  
chris-k:All changes to these issues will require to not use 0dt
 
 
  
Justin Edelson:@chris-k agreed, which is why I was surprised by this
mandate from Pierre
 
 
  
chris-k:he must fail
 
 
  
chris-k:sorry
