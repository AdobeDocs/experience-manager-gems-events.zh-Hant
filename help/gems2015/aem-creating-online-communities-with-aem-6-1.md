# Create online communities with AEM 6.1{#creating-online-communities-with-aem}

Imagine being able to stand up a community site in hours rather than weeks with little to no assistance from your CQ engineers. AEM Communities 6.1 will be focusing on providing this ability via a wizard-driven templated approach to cover a variety of initial use cases. AEM Communities 6.1 will also provide the ability to further customize these new community sites via AEM's WCM [!DNL Sites] capability. Join us to learn how to leverage AEM’s powerful authoring interface to build a vibrant customer community and learn the tools to keep your fan base engaged long after launch.
